# RedMind AI – Autonomous AI for Penetration Testing

RedMind AI is an autonomous neural network that performs ethical penetration testing using advanced LLMs, Shodan, and Burp Suite.  
It allows developers, startups, and teams to audit their web services with just a domain or IP — no deep security knowledge required.

## 🔍 Features

- Shodan API Integration: automatic scanning of open ports, services, technologies  
- LLM-based Analysis: using DeepSeek-Coder 33B or similar models to analyze gathered data  
- Burp Suite Interaction: generation and testing of PoCs via HTTP request simulation  
- Security Reports: clear, structured reports with CVSS scores and remediation guidance  
- Web / Telegram UI (planned): easy-to-use interface for security testing
